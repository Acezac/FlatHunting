FlatHunting
===========

That application was developed as part of my master's final project. 
It examines the feasibility and usability of an alternative user interface that uses multiple devices to offer a 
better user experience. The implementation is based on MVC architecture because it provides separation of concerns. 
PHP on the server side and Android on the client side were used for the implementation of the project.

To get the whole functionality of the application three mobile devices are demanded. 
For example, you have in one device only the map with the flats, in a second device only a list with the flats 
and in a third device the details of each flat advert. 
When the user taps on a flat the rest of the screens are updated. 
For instance, the list highlights the flat option, the map zoom in and the details display this flat. 
This operation is triggered automatically. 
The number of the devices is unlimited but there are need to be at least three. 
Each device can display different or the same content.
